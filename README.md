### Hi there 👋

# What I'm working on
Understanding how to structure information and build websites is helpful in my work as an [art director](https://alternatyves.com) and [story artist](https://film-storyboards.com). 
You can find solutions and themes used for some of my projects here. 
I build minimal, modular tools for creators, with a fondness for  [Jekyll themes](https://github.com/YJPL/YJPL/blob/master/README.md#jekyll-themes) and Markdown-based workflows.

So far, I have written portfolio and (web) comics themes for Jekyll and WordPress, a `coming soon` template for Jekyll, and a simple e-commerce Jekyll theme with Gumroad integration.

Please visit [Templates Supply](https://templates.supply) if you need a specific layout template for screen or print use, especially for filmmaking.
