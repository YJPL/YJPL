### Hi there 👋

# What I'm working on
I am an [illustrator/designer](https://alternatyves.com) and [story artist](https://film-storyboards.com), interested in developing and sharing [templates](https://templates.supply) and Jekyll themes.

So far, I have written portfolio and (web) comics themes for Jekyll and WordPress, a coming soon template for Jekyll, and a simple e-commerce theme for Jekyll with Gumroad integration.
