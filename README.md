### Hi there 👋

# What I'm working on
Understanding how to structure information and build websites is helpful in my work as a [designer](https://alternatyves.com) and [story artist](https://film-storyboards.com). You will find solutions and themes used for some of my projects here. For sites, I mainly use, develop and maintain [Jekyll themes](https://github.com/YJPL/YJPL/blob/master/README.md#jekyll-themes), although planning to port some of these to Eleventy.

So far, I have written portfolio and (web) comics themes for Jekyll and WordPress, a `coming soon` template for Jekyll, and a simple e-commerce Jekyll theme with Gumroad integration.

If you are looking for specific layout templates for screen and print use and filmmaking templates in particular, please visit [Templates Supply](https://templates.supply).
