### Hi there 👋

# What I'm working on
Understanding how to structure information and build websites is helpful in my work as an [art director](https://alternatyves.com) and [story artist](https://film-storyboards.com). 
You can find solutions and themes used for some of my projects here. 
To design for the web, I mainly use, develop, and maintain [Jekyll themes](https://github.com/YJPL/YJPL/blob/master/README.md#jekyll-themes). Over the years, Jekyll remains one of the most robust solutions for small projects. It is simple, stable, and organized. In time some of these might get a rewrite to Eleventy.

So far, I have written portfolio and (web) comics themes for Jekyll and WordPress, a `coming soon` template for Jekyll, and a simple e-commerce Jekyll theme with Gumroad integration.

If you need a specific layout template for screen or print use, especially for filmmaking, please visit [Templates Supply](https://templates.supply).
